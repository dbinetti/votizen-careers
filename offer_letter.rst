I am pleased to offer you a position with Votizen, Incorporated (the **Company**), as {title}.  If you decide to join us, you will receive an annual salary of {compensation}, which will be paid semimonthly in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll procedures.  As an employee, you will also be eligible to receive certain employee benefits including the eligibility to participate in the Company’s medical, dental and vision insurance plans and the Company’s 401(k) plan, as and if they become available.  The Company reserves its right to modify job titles, salaries and benefits from time to time as it deems necessary and in its sole discretion.  

In addition, if you decide to join us, it will be recommended at the first meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors following your start date that the Company grant you the right to purchase {shares} shares (the **Shares**) of the Company’s restricted common stock on the terms and conditions set forth in the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement attached hereto (the **RSPA**).  Twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares shall be released from the Company’s Repurchase Option (as defined in the RSPA) one year from your first date of employment, and an additional one forty-eighth (1/48th) of the total number of Shares shall be released from the Repurchase Option on the first day of each month thereafter, until all Shares have been released on the four-year anniversary of your first date of employment, subject to your continuous status as a Service Provider, as described in the RSPA.  The grant of the right to purchase the Shares shall not confer any right to continued vesting or employment. 

The Company is excited about your joining and looks forward to a beneficial and productive relationship.  Nevertheless, you should be aware that your employment with the Company is for no specified period and constitutes at-will employment.  As a result, you are free to resign at any time, for any reason or for no reason.  Similarly, the Company is free to conclude its employment relationship with you at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice.  We request that, in the event of resignation, you give the Company at least two weeks notice.

The Company reserves the right to conduct background investigations and/or reference checks on all of its potential employees.  Your job offer, therefore, is contingent upon a clearance of such a background investigation and/or reference check, if any.

For purposes of federal immigration law, you will be required to provide to the Company documentary evidence of your identity and eligibility for employment in the United States.  Such documentation must be provided to us within three (3) business days of your date of hire, or our employment relationship with you may be terminated.

We also ask that, if you have not already done so, you disclose to the Company any and all agreements relating to your prior employment that may affect your eligibility to be employed by the Company or limit the manner in which you may be employed.  It is the Company’s understanding that any such agreements will not prevent you from performing the duties of your position and you represent that such is the case.  Moreover, you agree that, during the term of your employment with the Company, you will not engage in any other employment, occupation, consulting or other business activity directly related to the business in which the Company is now involved or becomes involved during the term of your employment, nor will you engage in any other activities that conflict with your obligations to the Company.  Similarly, you agree not to bring any third party confidential information to the Company, including that of your former employer, and that in performing your duties for the Company you will not in any way utilize any such information.

As a Company employee, you will be expected to abide by any and all company rules and standards relating to employment or the Company’s general business operations that may be communicated to employees from time to time.

As a condition of your employment, you are also required to sign and comply with an AtWill Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment and Arbitration Agreement which requires, among other provisions, the assignment of patent rights to any invention made during your employment at the Company, and nondisclosure of Company proprietary information.  In the event of any dispute or claim relating to or arising out of our employment relationship, you and the Company agree that (i) any and all disputes between you and the Company shall be fully and finally resolved by binding arbitration, (ii) you are waiving any and all rights to a jury trial but all court remedies will be available in arbitration, (iii) all disputes shall be resolved by a neutral arbitrator who shall issue a written opinion, (iv) the arbitration shall provide for adequate discovery, and (v) the Company shall pay for any administrative or hearing fees charged by the arbitrator except for any filing fees associated with any arbitration that you initiate up to the amount of filing fees you would have paid if you had filed a complaint in a court of law.  Please note that we must receive your signed Agreement before your first day of employment.  

To accept the Company’s offer, please sign and date this letter in the space provided below.  A duplicate original is enclosed for your records.  If you accept our offer, your first day of employment will be {start_date}.  This letter, along with any agreements relating to proprietary rights between you and the Company, set forth the terms of your employment with the Company and supersede any prior representations or agreements including, but not limited to, any representations made during your recruitment, interviews or preemployment negotiations, whether written or oral.  This letter, including, but not limited to, its at-will employment provision, may not be modified or amended except by a written agreement signed by the President of the Company and you.  This offer of employment will terminate if it is not accepted, signed and returned by {expire_date}.

We look forward to your favorable reply and to working with you at Votizen!
